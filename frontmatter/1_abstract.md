# Abstract

This work explores the modern web technologies from the perspective of building
real-time communication services that could improve or replace existing
internet communication solutions like email and chat.

With the proposed solution I will try answering some of the most challenging
aspects of the nowadays collaboration software. The final solution represents a
web service providing real-time communication features.

The user evaluation report is also part of this work. This shares the
experience of building a client for the new service and testing it. The
architecture and implementation details, along with the feedback from the user
testing also represent the subject of this work.
