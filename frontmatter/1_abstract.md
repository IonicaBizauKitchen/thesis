# Abstract

This work explores the modern web technologies from the perspective of building
real-time communication services that could improve or replace existing
internet communication solutions like email.

In the last chapters I will present a web solution to provide a faster,
friendlier and easier solution for today users to adopt in the hope of reducing
email from every day work.
