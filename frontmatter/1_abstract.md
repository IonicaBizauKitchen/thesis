# Abstract

This work explores the modern web technologies from the perspective of building
real-time communication services that could improve or replace existing
internet communication solutions like email and chat.

The research and development presented here can be best described as a fresh
approach on solving some of the challenges of the nowadays collaboration
software. The final solution can be described as a web service providing
real-time communication features.

The architecture and implementation details, specifications and the storage
solution, along with the evaluation report from user testing is also part of
this work. The last chapters share the experience of building a client for the
new service. In the conclusions I discuss the learned lessons and some of the
ideas worth exploring in future.
