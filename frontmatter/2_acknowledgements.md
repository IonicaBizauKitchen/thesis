# Acknowledgements

I would first like to thank my supervisor, Lect. Dr. Adrian Sterca for all his
support, input and help during meetings.

I would also like to thank my mother, who have been supportive and patient
with me during all this time at the university.

Finally, I would like to thank my co-founders and our investors, in particular
Alexandru and Ștefan Gugurel, Andreea Mihalcea, Cătălina Rusu and Vlad Stan,
for their trust and help during my time working together.
I've made a lot of friends during this time.
