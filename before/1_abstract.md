\frontmatter \chapter{Abstract}

Electronic mail or simply email, is currently the most wide-spread and adopted
solution for exchanging digital messages using internet. This techology was
designed in 90s and since than almost didn't change. The technological
challenges and social responsability that would imply replacing or improving
the email attracts lots of minds and companies today.

Some of the proposed alternatives for asynchronous or real-time internet
communication do a great job on improving on the problems email carries, but at
the moment there is no majorly adopted or supported solution. This among other
things could be explained either by user reluctance to new things or simply by
lack of usability or huge complexity of the solutions.

In 2014 I cofounded a technical startup which started addresing the problem of
an email alternative. We had a buget for half a year of research and
prototyping. I was responsible for solving any technical challenges that would
require to deliver the prototype. And along with the product development team
we had to develop the best possible user experience for a technology we
believed could seriously challenge email as the preferred communication tool.

The thesis includes the experience and results of building the prototype from
both, technical perspectives and as being part of the product development team.
