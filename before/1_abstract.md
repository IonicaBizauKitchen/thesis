\chapter{Abstract}

Electronic mail or simply email, is currently the most wide-spread and adopted
solution for exchanging digital messages using internet. This technology was
designed in 1993 and since then almost didn't change. The technological
challenges, market share and social responsibility that would imply replacing
or improving the email attracts lots of minds and companies today.

Some of the proposed alternatives for asynchronous or real-time internet
communication do a great job on improving on the problems email carries, but at
the moment there is no silver bullet to consider this subject closed. This
among other things could be explained either by user reluctance to new things
or simply by lack of usability or huge complexity of the solutions.

In 2013 I cofounded a technical startup which started addressing the problem of
an email alternative. My responsibilities among other things were to architect
and build a web application that could work as a better tool to communicate
inside smaller teams and eventually provide an alternative protocol to make the
communication possible in between other teams thus representing an alternative
to the email.

In this thesis I decided to highlight what I've learned by trying to solve the
real-time communication using web technologies and what were the challenges.

All the work was open sourced in 2014 due to us failing to find funds for
further development and traction.
